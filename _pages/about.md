**Chu, X.**, Li, Y.[Interacting with a humanized dual-LLM agent: an exploratory study of individual and collaborative modes in language proficiency and critical thinking awareness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10494820.2025.2601294) *Interactive Learning Environments*,2025,  https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2025.2601294.



- This study explores individual and collaborative interactions with a humanized dual-LLM GenAI agent, designed to enhance social presence and cognitive support, in foreign language learning. Results from a quasi-experimental study suggest that collaborative interaction is associated with higher language proficiency, while individual interaction uniquely supports critical thinking awareness. Interaction analysis further reveals distinct cognitive patterns across learning configurations.
