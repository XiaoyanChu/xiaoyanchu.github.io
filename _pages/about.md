- This study examined the potential of FCM enhanced by an AI-Generated Metaverse (AIGM) to improve learning outcomes in higher education. The study involved 94 university graduates who participated in an experimental FCM session. The findings indicated that the AIGM-FCM positively influenced learners’ academic performance. Interaction patterns revealed that students predominantly engaged with the AI virtual tutor at the onset and at the end of their learning sessions, primarily for the purpose of asking questions. However, the educational dialogues suggested that the depth of collaborative knowledge construction between students and the AI tutor remained at a basic level. Notably, students with lower academic performance were more likely to initiate inquiry-based dialogues with the AI tutor compared to their higher-achieving peers exhibiting a more focusing-oriented approach.
